*   First item with **bold text**.
*   Second item with *italicized text*.
*   A third item featuring `inline code`.

And here is an **ordered list**:

1.  Step one.
2.  Step two.

## Code Blocks (H2)

Code blocks are essential for technical documentation. Below is an example of a JavaScript code block, which should have syntax highlighting.

```javascript
// Example function for testing
function greet(name) {
  if (name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  } else {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
  }
}

greet('Velthoric User');
```

## Tables (H2)

Tables should render correctly and be horizontally scrollable on mobile devices.

| Feature           | Status      | Priority |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Versioning System | ✔ Complete  | High     |
| Code Highlighting | ✔ Complete  | High     |
| Responsive Design | In Progress | Medium   |
| Dark Mode Toggle  | Planned     | Low      |
