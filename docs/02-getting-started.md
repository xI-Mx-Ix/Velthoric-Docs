# 02 - Getting Started with XBullet

## Setting Up Your Project

To use XBullet in your Minecraft mod, you first need to add it to your project. If you use Gradle as your build system, add this dependency to your build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation '...'
}
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?

After adding the dependency, you can start using XBullet to create physics simulations in your Minecraft mod.
